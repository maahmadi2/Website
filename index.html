        <p>PetroChina [Data Scientist]- Calgary, AB, Canada   
            February 2022-Present (Azure/PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Python/PowerBI/Fabric/Databricks) 
                 Analyzed large and complex data sets related to oil production, including geological data, drilling results, 
                and production data, to identify patterns and make recommendations for optimizing production. 
                 Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including engineers, geologists, and operations personnel, to 
                develop predictive models and optimize production processes. 
                 Utilized machine learning and statistical methods to forecast future production, identify potential 
                production bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation for maximum efficiency and profitability. 
        Ada Analytics [Data Scientist-Internship]-Vancouver, BC, Canada  
            February 2021-May 2021 (PostgreSQL/Python/PowerBI)  
                 Developed a time-series predictive model for home temperature to minimize fire risks. 
                 Cleaned and prepared data from clients using PostgreSQL. 
        Equinor Company [Data Analytics Researcher]-St. John’s, NL, Canada  
            September 2016–December 2017 (Python/R/MySQL/PowerBI)  
                 Determined the relevant parameters in carbon dioxide (CO2)-Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) based on the 
                objective function (hydrocarbon production/Net Present Value) through statistical analysis and prepared a 
                new database eastern offshore field using Python and MySQL. 
                 Developed a predictive model for CO2 injection performance in an eastern Canada offshore reservoir using 
                data analytics techniques like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in R and 
                Python. 
        National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) [Reservoir Engineer]-Tehran, Iran  
            September 2015 – September 2016. (Python/PowerBI)  
                 Preparation of Well History Reports (Drilling, Completion, Workover, Perforations/Open Hole, Stimulation,
